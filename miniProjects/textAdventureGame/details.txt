A basic text terminal game made in Python. The primary goal is to collect 3 keys which are locked behind various simple puzzles. Or you can play around and find all the alternate endings.

I have also included a spreadsheet from when I drafted the room layout and .png of the map in the 'cheatsheet' folder in case you get lost.

> Features:
  - You input basic movement and interaction commands ('north', 'take', 'info' etc).
  - Interact with simple monsters, traps, and other NPCs.
  - Collect all 3 keys and unlock the final door to get the 'intended' ending.
  - Funny jokes. At least, I think so.

> How to Use It:
  - Run it in either your IDE of choice, or run it in Command Prompt.
    - To run it in Command Prompt, copy the directory and type 'cd My\Directory\Here'. This will temporarily set the directory for the next command.
      - Then, type 'py textAdventureGame.py' and the script will execute.

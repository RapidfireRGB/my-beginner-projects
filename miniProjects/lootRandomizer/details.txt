This was my first ever project. I got the idea after seeing an example of a nested 'for' loop creating an array.

> What It Does:
  - Creates a random pool of items using base material (iron) and item type (dagger)
  - Randomly selects one with weighted odds
  - Prints the resulting item
  - Also, rolls a 1 in 5 chance to get a bonus item

To use it, just run the script in either an IDE or by using Command Prompt.
    To run it in Command Prompt, copy the directory and type 'cd My\Directory\Here'. This will temporarily set the directory for the next command.
    Then, type 'py lootRandomizer.py' and the script will execute.

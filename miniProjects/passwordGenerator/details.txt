> What It Does:
  - Defines each element of the password  (numbers, special characters, etc) as separate lists 
  - Prompts user for desired password length and password elements
  - Prints resulting string to the console.

> How to Use It:
  - Run it in either your IDE of choice, or run it in Command Prompt.
    - To run it in Command Prompt, copy the directory and type 'cd My\Directory\Here'. This will temporarily set the directory for the next command.
      - Then, type 'py passwordGenerator.py' and the script will execute.

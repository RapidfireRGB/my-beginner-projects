I made a simple and very bad calculator that takes text input. Yuck.

Both the source .cpp file and executable are included.

> What It Does:
  - Input your first, then second number you wish to perform an operation on. Then input which operation you want it to perform.
  - Calculates and prints the result.

> How to Use It:
  - Run it in either your IDE of choice, or run it in Command Prompt.
    - To run it in Command Prompt, copy the directory and type 'cd My\Directory\Here' into Command Prompt. This will temporarily set the directory for the next command.
      - Then, type 'calculator.exe' and the code will execute.

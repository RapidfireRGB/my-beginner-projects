This directory contains a few functions I have written to basically create shortcuts for myself.

Basic Types
  str_func.h: Basic string manipulation such as slicing and re-arranging.
  num_func.h: Arithmetic and Comparison such as sum, mean, and is prime.
  bool_func.h: Boolean transformations such as to integer or string; bool vector manipulation such as counting # of true/false

Container Types
  vect_func.h: Vector manipulation such as reversal, slicing, filtering; transformations such as char to int, and char to string literal.
  map_func.h: Map manipulation such as conditional insertion; transformations such as map to pair vector.

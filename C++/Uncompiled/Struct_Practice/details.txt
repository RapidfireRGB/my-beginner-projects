This folder contains structs I wrote to practice object oriented programming in C++.

  2dgrid_type.cpp: Work in Progress. Goal is to create a functional (x, y) grid where each coordinate point can contain objects.

  3dgeometry_types.cpp: Defining basic three-dimensional shapes to practice inheritance and polymorphism.

  block_type.cpp: My attempt at creating a container type. A block stores up to 4 integers at a time and can be accessed by indexing. My goal is to have unused integers be totally nonexistent, but for now they are represented with a value of 0.

  fraction_type.cpp: Defines type fraction with a numerator and denominator. Has methods for doing basic arithmetic with fractions (addition, multiplication etc).

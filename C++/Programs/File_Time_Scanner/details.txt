Very basic tool that fetches timestamps for a file's creation and last edit. Also fetches the file's size in Bytes. The program will optionally output to a .txt file.
Both the .cpp and .exe are included.

IMPORTANT: Make sure the file you want to fetch is in the same directory as the .exe at runtime.

> How to Use It:
  - To run it in Command Prompt, copy the directory and type 'cd My\Directory\Here' into Command Prompt. This will temporarily set the directory for the next command.
    - Then, type 'file_time.exe' and the code will execute.
      - Once executed, paste the full path of a file, including the name of the file. Be sure to remove quotation marks as that will result in an error.

I was playing Classic World of Warcraft and thought it would be nice to know how many mobs I would need to level up. So here it is.

I have included both the source .cpp file and the executable. Do whatever you want with it.

> What It Does:
  - Prompts user for their character's current level and xp.
  - Calculates and prints how much xp is needed to level up, and how many mobs you would need to slay to get there. Also, prints how many mobs are needed if you have Rested xp the whole time.

> How to Use It:
  - Run it in either your IDE of choice, or run it in Command Prompt.
    - To run it in Command Prompt, copy the directory and type 'cd My\Directory\Here' into Command Prompt. This will temporarily set the directory for the next command.
      - Then, type 'xpCalc.exe' and the code will execute.

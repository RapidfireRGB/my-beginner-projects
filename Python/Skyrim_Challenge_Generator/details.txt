I am a huge Skyrim fan, so I came up with a simple script that generates ideas for challenge runs for myself. My initial idea also involved restricting certain attributes (Health, Magicka, Stamina), but I never got around to implementing it.

> What It Does:
  - Defines lists of elements such as the core challenge and goal, and possible starting Race, Location, etc
  - Prints one iteration for each of these lists, except for Attributes (which I have yet to implement)

> How to Use It:
  - Run it in either your IDE of choice, or run it in Command Prompt.
    - To run it in Command Prompt, copy the directory and type 'cd My\Directory\Here'. This will temporarily set the directory for the next command.
      - Then, type 'py skyrimChallengeGenerator.py' and the script will execute.

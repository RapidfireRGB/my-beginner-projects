# my-beginner-projects
A Repository dedicated to small, standalone projects built by me.


All projects here were made to help me learn a particular programming language.
I have included a 'details.txt' file in each subdirectory to explain roughly how each project works.


Feel free to browse them, clone them, or do whatever you want.


I will not update files here very frequently, but I may add new projects from time to time as I learn new programming languages.
